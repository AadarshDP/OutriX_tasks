# OutriX Internship Tasks – Data Science (2025)
 - This repository contains the three main projects completed as part of my **Data Science Internship with OutriX**.
 - The internship was focused on building practical experience through real-world datasets, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.
---

## 🚀 Internship Overview

- **Program:** Data Science Internship – OutriX EdTech
- **Duration:** 2 Month
- **Mode:** REMOTE
- Throughout the internship, I worked on hands-on tasks that involved exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, content-based filtering, and advanced data visualization using Python and related libraries.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each task is organized in its own folder with the respective notebook (`.ipynb`), dataset(s), and a README describing the work done.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### 1️⃣ Student Performance Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze student academic performance data to uncover trends, calculate averages, and visualize insights.

**Highlights:**
- Cleaned and prepared exam performance dataset
- Visualized average scores, top scorers, and section-based comparisons
- Tools: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

---

### 2️⃣ Movie Recommender System
**Goal:** Build a content-based recommendation system using cast and crew metadata to suggest similar movies.

**Highlights:**
- Extracted cast + director, created combined feature vectors
- Applied `CountVectorizer` and cosine similarity for recommendations
- Clustering using `KMeans` + dimensionality reduction via `SVD`
- Tools: `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`

---

### 3️⃣ COVID-19 Data Analysis
**Goal:** Explore and visualize the progression of COVID-19 using global datasets and early case data.

**Highlights:**
- Time-series analysis of confirmed, recovered, and death cases
- Visualized top-affected countries and early 2020 trends
- Tools: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, `Seaborn`
  
🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis – Task 3 Completed!
I'm excited to share the third task I completed during my Data Science Internship at @OutriX: COVID-19 Data Analysis.
This task focused on exploring the progression and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using multiple datasets, and turning raw numbers into interactive and informative visual insights.


💡 Key Objectives:
Cleaned and merged daily and country-level COVID-19 datasets
Parsed dates and filled missing values for accurate analysis
Calculated and visualized daily new cases, deaths, and recoveries
Analyzed and ranked countries based on confirmed cases and fatalities
Explored early outbreak data (Jan 2020) to visualize global spread


📊 Visualizations Created:
Line plot of global cumulative cases (confirmed, recovered, deaths)
Daily new cases and recovery trends
Bar charts of top 10 & top 15 countries by cases and deaths
Treemap showing country-wise distribution of confirmed cases
Early case comparison (Jan 21–26, 2020) by country


🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Jupyter Notebook

🙌 Thank you @OutriX for this challenge! This task deepened my ability to work with time-series data, clean multiple datasets, and communicate insights clearly through visualizations.
