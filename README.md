# OutriX Internship Tasks – Data Science (2025)
 - This repository contains the three main projects completed as part of my **Data Science Internship with OutriX**.
 - The internship was focused on building practical experience through real-world datasets, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.
---

## 🚀 Internship Overview

- **Program:** Data Science Internship – OutriX EdTech
- **Duration:** 1 Month
- **Mode:** REMOTE
- Throughout the internship, I worked on hands-on tasks that involved exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, content-based filtering, and advanced data visualization using Python and related libraries.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### 1️⃣ Student Performance Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze student academic performance data to uncover trends, calculate averages, and visualize insights.

**Highlights:**
- Cleaned and prepared exam performance dataset
- Visualized average scores, top scorers, and section-based comparisons
- Tools: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

---

### 2️⃣ Movie Recommender System
**Goal:** Build a content-based recommendation system using cast and crew metadata to suggest similar movies.

**Highlights:**
- Extracted cast + director, created combined feature vectors
- Applied `CountVectorizer` and cosine similarity for recommendations
- Clustering using `KMeans` + dimensionality reduction via `SVD`
- Tools: `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`

---

### 3️⃣ COVID-19 Data Analysis
**Goal:** Explore and visualize the progression of COVID-19 using global datasets and early case data.

**Highlights:**
- Time-series analysis of confirmed, recovered, and death cases
- Visualized top-affected countries and early 2020 trends
- Tools: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, `Seaborn`
